<h1>The Best Movies/Series according to Dhruvansh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all the time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Cars Series</h3>
<p>This series by Pixar Animation Studios has always fascinated me. It is basically divided
    into three parts and i am really hoping for the 4th part to come out soon
</p>
<h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>This is my go time webseries. I always watch it when i have nothing to do or when i am eating food simply
    I have watched it for a minimum of 8 times.<br> I started watching it in my 11-12 grade and i finished it for the first time in 12th grade
    I cried when watching the last episode of the last season. <br>It is basically divided into 12 seasons with like 20 episodes of 22 minutes or approx each. Its a scifi romcom
</p>
<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>So peer pressure made me watch this after my JEE and let me tell you its the best sci-fi series i have ever seen. 
    Most people say that it is childish but nope. Stranger Things Summer hits differently. <br>The last and the final season
    is yet to stream this year i.e November 2025
